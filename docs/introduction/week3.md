# Week 3: State Estimation & Introduction to ROS

In our final foundational week, we tackle one of the most critical problems in mobile robotics: **state estimation**. A robot must know where it is to perform any useful task. We will explore how robots build maps and locate themselves within them.

We will also have our first introduction to the **Robot Operating System (ROS)**, the software framework that will be the backbone for all our projects.

## Topics Covered

-   Probabilistic robotics and Bayes filters.
-   Overview of SLAM algorithms.
-   Introduction to the ROS 2 architecture.
-   Creating your first ROS 2 package and node.
