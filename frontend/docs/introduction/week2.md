# Week 2: Real-Time Control & Sensor Fusion

This week, we move from the theory of motion to the practice of making robots move reliably and perceive their environment accurately.

We will first explore **real-time control systems**, which are essential for robots to operate safely and effectively in dynamic environments. Then, we will cover **sensor fusion**, the process of combining data from multiple sensors to produce more accurate and reliable information than could be obtained from any single sensor alone.

## Topics Covered

-   Hard and soft real-time systems.
-   PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control.
-   Introduction to the Kalman Filter.
-   Fusing IMU and camera data for robust pose estimation.
