# Week 1: Introduction to Humanoid Robotics & Kinematics

Welcome to the first week of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"!

This week, we will lay the groundwork for the entire course. We begin by defining "Physical AI" and exploring why humanoid robots are a key platform for its advancement. We will then dive into the fundamental concept of **kinematics**, the study of motion.

## Topics Covered

-   What is Physical AI?
-   History and motivation for humanoid robots.
-   Forward Kinematics: Calculating a robot's end-effector position from its joint angles.
-   Inverse Kinematics: Calculating the required joint angles to reach a target end-effector position.
